# Basic One-Way Micro FrontEnd Example

This example demos a basic host application loading remote component.

- `main` is the host application.
- `app1` standalone application which exposes `Button` component.
- `app2` standalone application which exposes `Button` component.

# Running Demo

Run `yarn start`. This will build and serve both `app1` and `app2` on ports 3001 and 3002 respectively.

- [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/) (HOST)
- [localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002/) (STANDALONE REMOTE)
- [localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003/) (STANDALONE REMOTE)
